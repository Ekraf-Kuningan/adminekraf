# Testing the Subsector Integration

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Subsector Loading
- Navigate to the Category Management screen
- Verify that subsectors are loading properly
- Check that the subsector dropdown shows available options

### 2. Test Category Creation
- Click the "+" button to add a new category
- Fill in the category name
- Select a subsector from the dropdown
- Verify the form validation works (requires both name and subsector)
- Submit the form and verify no 400 error occurs

### 3. Test Category Editing
- Edit an existing category
- Verify that the current subsector is pre-selected
- Change the subsector and save
- Verify the changes are applied correctly

### 4. Test Error Handling
- Try to create a category without selecting a subsector
- Verify proper error message is shown
- Try to create a category without a name
- Verify proper error message is shown

## Expected Results

1. **Subsector Loading**: The subsector dropdown should populate with available subsectors
2. **Category Creation**: Should succeed with proper subsector selection and fail with appropriate error messages when required fields are missing
3. **Category Editing**: Should pre-populate with existing subsector and allow changes
4. **Error Handling**: Should show clear error messages for missing required fields

## API Request Verification

The API request should now include the `sub_sector_id` field:
```json
{
  "name": "Test Category",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "sub_sector_id": "1"
}
```

This should resolve the 400 Bad Request error that was occurring due to the missing required field.

## Next Steps

If testing reveals any issues:
1. Check console logs for any API errors
2. Verify subsector API endpoint is working
3. Ensure proper error handling in the UI
4. Check that the form validation is working correctly
